## 🛠️ **How We Built It**

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Magic**
We used **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** with the **TensorFlow** framework to build our recommendation model. Here's how it works:
1. **Data Training**: We trained our model using a dataset from Kaggle with 437 rows and 2 columns (destination names and categories).
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: The model processes user preferences, predicts scores for destinations, and recommends the top 19 destinations based on those scores.
3. **Recommendations**: Users get personalized suggestions tailored to their interests. Cool, right? 😎
